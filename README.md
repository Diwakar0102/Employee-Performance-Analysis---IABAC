# 📊 IABAC Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my **IABAC Certified Data Science Project**, completed as part of the IABAC certification program.  
The project demonstrates **end-to-end data science workflow**, from data cleaning to model deployment.

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Build Machine Learning models for prediction  
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics  
- Generate business insights from data  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple features related to the prediction problem.  
*(Exact dataset is part of the IABAC program and not included here.)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Approach
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building (Classification/Regression based on case)  
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.)  
6. Business Recommendations  

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved **82% accuracy** / performance score.  
- Extracted insights useful for real-world applications.
